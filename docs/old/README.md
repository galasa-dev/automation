This folder is to store old documentation that describes the mechanism we previously used to block malicious code from untrusted committers from being built by Tekton and therefore making it to IBM machines. There are currently no Tekton pipelines that would be triggered via Pull Request so this mechanism is no longer used. Keeping the docs here in case this mechanism is ever needed in future and these docs should be reinstated.
